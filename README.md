Laboratory Help Seeking System

#### Problem
 Students are often stuck in lab waiting for the TA to help them with something. Often times, the student's question can be answered in a minute or two but there are so many other students with questions that the TA is not able to get to a student for 10 or 15 minutes, if not longer. Another related problem is that TA's are unable to track the order in which students generate questions and some students are skipped unfairly. The current method of raising your hand for 10 minutes and waiting for the TA to answer a question that he or she has probably already answered to someone else is ineffeient, unfair, and is capable of being improved through software engineering.


#### Proposed Solution
create a website students can go to that allows them to submit a question for a specific lab.
        
######functionality of site for TA's:           
- create a lab event for a specific lab section on a specific day
- Be alerted when a certain question receives more than 2 '+1's', which are when other students see a question already posted
and realize they have the same question
- See the questions in the order they were submitted so that students are not stuck waiting in lab for a long time
- Perhaps note the amount of questions a student has asked, giving a certain amount of priority to students who have asked fewer questions
            
       
###### functionality of site for students:
- View questions other students have posted
- If a student has the same question as one already asked, they can click a '+1' button next to the question to indicate they have the same question

#### Actors
- Users: Students and TA's
- Beneficiaries: Students and TA's
