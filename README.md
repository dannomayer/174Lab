# 174Lab
Laboratory Help Seeking System

Problem:


Proposed Solution: create a website students can go to that allows them to submit a question for a specific lab.
        functionality of site for TA's:
            -create a lab event for a specific lab section on a specific day
            -Be alerted when a certain question receives more than 2 '+1's', which are when other students see a question already posted
            and realize they have the same question
            -See the questions in the order they were submitted so that students are not stuck waiting in lab for a long time
            -Perhaps note the amount of questions a student has asked, giving a certain amount of priority to students who have asked fewer questions
        functionality of site for students:
            -View questions other students have posted
            -If a student has the same question as one already asked, they can click a '+1' button next to the question to indicate they have the same question
